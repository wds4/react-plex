Plex-Builder12
Plan: clone create-react-app (which I used for plex originally) and try to add ipfs-desktop functionality; package together as single app
Modifications similar to what I did to build plex originally:
Follow this guide: https://www.section.io/engineering-education/desktop-application-with-react/
Then follow this guide:
https://blog.bitsrc.io/building-an-electron-app-with-electron-react-boilerplate-c7ef8d010a91
to learn how to make multiple pages (and maybe learn to package the electron app using electron-builder?).
Removed web-vitals bc maybe spyware??? and not in second demo.

clone create-react-app to iMac
npm install
npm i -D electron electron-is-dev
